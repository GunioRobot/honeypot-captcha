# Honeypot Captcha

**The simplest way to add honeypot captchas in your Rails forms.**

Honeypot captchas work off the premise that you can present different form
fields to a spam bot than you do to a real user. Spam bots will typically try
to fill all fields in a form and will not take into account CSS styles.

We add bogus fields to a form and then check to see if those fields are
submitted with values. If they are, we assume that we encountered a spam bot.

## Installation

In your Gemfile, simply add

    gem 'honeypot-captcha'

## Usage

I've tried to make it pretty simple to add a honeypot captcha, but I'm open to
any suggestions you may have.

### form_for

Simply specify that the form has a honeypot in the HTML options hash:

    <% form_for Comment.new, :html => { :honeypot => true } do |form| -%>
      ...
    <% end -%>

### form_tag with block

Simply specify that the form has a honeypot in the options hash:

    <% form_tag comments_path, :honeypot => true do -%>
      ...
    <% end -%>

### form_tag without block

Simply specify that the form has a honeypot in the options hash:

    <%= form_tag comments_path, :honeypot => true -%>
      ...
    </form>

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
